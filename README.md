# chocdoom - Chocolate Doom for UWP

Chocolate Doom is a source port of the Doom engine which is capable of running DOOM, Heretic, Hexen and Strife. This port to the Xbox One is intended only to run these games in singleplayer mode with the Xbox One Controller or a Keyboard and Mouse (when such support arrives). The aim of this port is to maintain as much vanilla DOOM functionality as possible but make allowances for ease-of-use on console.
